Flutter Q&A App
This Flutter-based Question and Answer (Q&A) application enables users to create and engage in a simple forum-like environment directly on their devices. Users can post questions, provide answers to existing questions, and browse through the discussion threads in a clean, user-friendly interface. Data is stored locally on the device using JSON files, ensuring persistence even when offline.

Features
Post Questions: Users can create new questions with titles and optional content to seek help or start discussions.

Answer Questions: Users can contribute answers to any existing question, facilitating a collaborative Q&A experience.

Intuitive UI: View questions and their answers in an intuitive UI

Local Data Persistence: All questions and answers are saved locally in JSON format using the path_provider plugin, allowing the app to function without internet access.

Cross-Platform Support: Works seamlessly on Android, iOS, and desktop platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

How It Works
The app manages Q&A data with a local JSON file stored in the application documents directory. Upon launch, the app loads existing questions and answers from the file. Users can add new questions or answer existing ones, which updates the JSON file accordingly.

Platform Support
This app relies on the path_provider plugin for file storage, making it compatible with:

Mobile: Android, iOS

Desktop: Windows, macOS, Linux
